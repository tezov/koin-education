# Dependency Injection — Manual implementation (Part 1)

This repository contains the source code for **Part 1** of an educational series about dependency injection.

The goal of this first part is to show that **dependency injection is a design principle**, not a framework.  
Before introducing Koin or any other tool, the example demonstrates how dependency injection can be implemented **manually**, using plain Kotlin and constructor injection.

## What this part covers

- What dependency injection really is
- Why splitting responsibilities naturally leads to DI
- Constructor injection as the simplest and safest form of DI
- The limitations of manual wiring
- Why dependency injection frameworks exist

The example uses a small `Software / Engine / Simulator` model to make dependencies explicit and easy to follow, without introducing any framework or magic.
